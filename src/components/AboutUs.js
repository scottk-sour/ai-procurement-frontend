        <h2>Welcome to [Your Platform Name]</h2>
        <p>
          I'm Scott Davies, and I've spent over 25 years in sales, procurement, and digital marketing. Throughout my career, I've witnessed firsthand the challenges businesses face when sourcing reliable vendors for office equipment. Many organizations struggle with time-consuming and costly procurement processes, often falling victim to aggressive sales tactics that promise the world but fail to deliver.
        </p>
        <p>
          In today's competitive landscape, companies are under pressure to reduce costs while employees seek higher wages and commissions. Additionally, hiring and training new employees can be an expensive gambleâ€”after three months, many prove to be poor fits or move on, wasting valuable time and resources.
